# Who's Most Likely?

Who's most likely is a party game where players vote on who in their group a prompt pertains to most. In this rendition, players first enter a prompt on their device, then vote one by one on each prompt displayed. Results are displayed between prompts after voting has concluded.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still very much a work in progress. Expect bugs, especially with the game state.

## Apps
